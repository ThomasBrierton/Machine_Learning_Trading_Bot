# Machine_Learning_Trading_Bot

This Machine Learning Trading Bot combines algorithmic trading skills with Python programming and machine learning that learns and adapts to new data and evolving markets. This gives firms a competitive advantage in terms of data processing speed, decision making, and atomated algorithmic trading.

## Approach

The following steps are completed in a Jupyter notebook:

1. Implement an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate the trade decisions.
2. Adjust the input parameters to optimize the trading algorithm.
3. Train a new machine learning model and compare its performance to that of a baseline model.

## Technologies

This project uses Jupyter notebook and the standard Python 3.8 libraries. This project requires the following libraries and/or dependencies:

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - a software library designed for open source data analysis and manipulation.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - HoloViews is an open-source Python library designed to make data analysis and visualization seamless and simple.
- [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/)) - A high-level plotting API for the PyData ecosystem built on HoloViews.
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
